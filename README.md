# PROJECT : Text-Summarization

Text summarization is the task of shortening long pieces of text into a concise summary that preserves key information, content and overall meaning of the text. This project uses HuggingFace Transformers, which offer pretrained Transformers, for performing easy text summarization. Summarization is usually done using an encoder-decoder model, such as Bart or T5. We have used both in this project.

# PROJECT : Retail Forecasting

Time series analysis of a publicly available retail dataset and forecast of future sales using recurrent neural network and kerasâ€™ Sequential Model API.


# PROJECT : Starbucks

The objective of this project is to:

I. Perform exploratory analysis of the three datasets.\
II. Calculate the success rate of a particular offer.\
III. A random forest classifier model was trained to predict the success of the offer. The hyperparameters were tuned using the randomized grid search.

# PROJECT : Disaster Response Pipeline

The dataset provided by Figure Eight contains pre-labelled tweet and messages from real-life disasters. The project is aimed at using ML and building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to categorize these messages on a real time basis.

This project has the following sections:

Processing data, building an ETL pipeline, cleaning the data and saving it in a SQLite database\
Building a machine learning pipeline to train a model which can classify the messages into various categories\
Running a web app using flask which can be used to visualise the results in real time

# PROJECT : Recommendation System

Analyzed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and made recommendations about new articles that are most pertinent to a specific user. After Exploratory Data Analysis to answer some basic, required questions about the data, the most popular articles based on the most interactions were found (Rank Based Recommendations). To improve the recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering was performed to find users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users. This would be a step in the right direction towards more personal recommendations for the users. Next, Matrix Factorization algorithm was used to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower dimensionality rectangular matrices.

# PROJECT : Seattle Airbnb Exploratory Analysis

This is a project aimed at analysing the datasets provided by Airbnb on its activity in Seattle, WA, USA. The project employs the use of the CRISP-DM process and explores three separate datasets that describe the listing activity of homestays in Seattle since 2008.\
A detailed explanation of the results is posted on [Medium](https://renalka.medium.com/seattle-airbnb-exploratory-analysis-4ff36fddf9bc).

# PROJECT : Cancer Detection Using Mammograph Classification

Using real world data of masses detected in mammograms to determine whether or not those masses are benign or malignant in nature.\
We have used supervised classification machine learning techniques and pitted them against each other. Based on its measurements using multiple different classification techniques we see which one does the best.
Dataset used : "mammographic masses" public dataset from the UCI repository (source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)\
We will apply different supervised machine learning techniques to this dataset and model evaluation will be done using K-Fold cross validation (K=10).
